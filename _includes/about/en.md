Hey, I am Mohsin Qureshi (a.k.a. Moss). I am a Software/Data Engineer and am currently working at Scotiabanks's Anti-Money-Laundering Data Team.

I create data intensive applications with the intent to simplify and derive insights.

I have also conducted research on the regularization of Deep Learning architectures with mutual information measures during my masters at Ryerson University.

I graduated in Computer Engineering from Carleton University and followed it up with a part-time Masters of Computer Engineering (with a focus on Deep Learning, mainly supervised by <a href="http://narimanfarsad.com/">Prof. Nariman Farsad</a>) at Ryerson University.
